# edup-ep-wr2603
Update firmware on Edup ep-wr2603 wireless router (manufactured in 2012. by Spacetek as st-rw1305FN-NTP)

## Why?
With factory firmware ver 1.0.0 my router misbehaved, wifi part hanging after a random while.

## Prerequisites

You should know Chinese language or be able to use some kind of translation tool. After flashing user interface will be in Chinese.

## Where to get the firmware

I couldn't find any firmware for this exact model but it seems that ep-wr2602 was close enough. I have flashed this firmware with success!
