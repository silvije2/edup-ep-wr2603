# edup-ep-wr2603
Update firmware on Edup ep-wr2603 wireless router (manufactured in 2012. by Spacetek as st-rw1305FN-NTP)

## Why?
My router behaves strange, wifi part hangs after a random while.

Hopefully it is a software error but firmware upgrade is nowhere to be found.
If I cannot solve this problem it is going to the recycling yard, but lets give it a shot.
Maybe it is hardware error but reflow gun did not help at all.

## Prerequisites

You should know Chinese language or be able to use some kind of translation tool after flashing :)

## Where to get the firmware

Download firmware image from http://www.edup.cn/support/xiazaizhongxin/ep-wr2602chanpingujian/

**It is firmware for completely different wifi router model! But it was most similar to ep-wr2603 so I gave it a shot.
Upgrade went with success in my case. The only thing is that user interface is now in Chinese language.
So i have to use translation tools as I do not understand one word.**

So maybe this two models are same hardware?

Upgrade at your own risk!

## Firmware versions

Factory firmware version was v1.0.0 dated somewhere in 2012.

Version of this firmware for wr2602 model is v1.0.1 dated 2013/11/21.


## Have I solved my problem?

Don't know yet! Still testing but so far so good!
